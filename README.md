# MediBridge

**MediBridge** is an agentic RAG assistant for **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)** in Australia. It answers natural-language questions about MBS items, insurer benefits, waiting periods, policy rules, and (for Queensland) clinic lookup. A **LangGraph** ReAct agent orchestrates tools over **SQLite** (structured MBS, insurers, clinics) and **ChromaDB** (semantic search over item text and policy chunks).

Available via a **Rich terminal CLI**, a **web UI** (static SPA + streaming chat), or the **HTTP API** under `/api`.

---

## Features

- **Hybrid MBS search** — Reciprocal rank fusion of Chroma embeddings (60%) and SQLite FTS5 keyword search (40%); degrades to FTS-only if the vector store is unavailable.
- **Coverage calculator** — IMAP eligibility gate, insurer exclusion keywords, benefit fields from MBS XML (with schedule-fee cap per deed), in-hospital 100%, anaesthesia and derived-fee handling.
- **Waiting periods** — Tier-specific rules with deed defaults.
- **Policy RAG** — `query_oshc_rules` over deed PDF, MBS book/item PDFs, and curated insurer markdown in Chroma.
- **Clinic search (Queensland)** — Filter by postcode and/or suburb; optional clinic type; data ingested from a bundled seed SQLite file.
- **Parallel tool calling** — LangGraph agent issues multiple independent lookups concurrently in a single turn.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **OpenAI API key** — used for chat (`gpt-5-nano`) and embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`)
- **Optional:** LangSmith env vars for tracing (see `.env.example`)

---

## Installation

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .

# For tests and wheel builds (not declared in pyproject.toml)
pip install pytest build
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always activate the venv before running `medibridge`, `medibridge-cli`, or any `python -m medibridge.*` command. Never hardcode `.venv/Scripts/...` paths in scripts or configs.

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set at minimum:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Optional LangSmith tracing:

```bash
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_...
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=medibridge
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
```

Runtime paths (SQLite, Chroma, profile JSON, seed sources) are defined in `src/medibridge/config.py`.

---

## Data you must supply (`knowledge/`)

The repository does **not** include government source files. Before ingestion, create a `knowledge/` directory at the repo root:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `knowledge/data/MBS-XML-20260301-version 2.XML` | MBS XML export |
| `knowledge/data/20260301_MBSONLINE_IMAP.TXT` | IMAP TSV (Windows-1252) |
| `knowledge/documents/deed-for-the-provision-of-overseas-student-health-cover-1-july-2025.pdf` | OSHC deed |
| `knowledge/documents/MBS Book - March 2026.pdf` | MBS book |
| `knowledge/documents/MBS Item Information.pdf` | Item information PDF |
| `knowledge/insurers/` | Per-insurer markdown (and comparisons if present) |
| `knowledge/reference/` | Additional reference markdown for rules embedding |

Place **`data/sources/clinics_qld.db`** in the repo so clinic ingestion can run; if missing, ingest continues and prints a skip message.

Generated artifacts (`data/medibridge.db`, `data/chroma/`, profile JSON) are gitignored.

---

## Ingestion

After `knowledge/` is in place, run:

```bash
python -m medibridge.data.ingest
```

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--skip-chroma` | SQLite and clinics only; no embeddings |
| `--no-reset` | Do not reset DB before writing (append-oriented re-run) |

> [!NOTE]
> Chroma ingestion requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`. If unset, vector indexing is skipped with a warning.

---

## Usage

### Web app

```bash
medibridge
```

Starts **Uvicorn** on **http://localhost:8000**. The React SPA is served from `ui/`; JSON routes are mounted under `/api` (chat, profile, insurers, MBS helpers, coverage, clinics).

### CLI

```bash
medibridge-cli
# or
python -m medibridge.cli
```

On first use, runs an onboarding wizard (insurer, tier, policy start date, cover type). Commands: `/quit`, `/reset`, `/item <num>`, `/profile`.

### Docker

```bash
# Build
docker build -t medibridge .

# Ingest inside container (first time)
docker run --rm \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  -v "$(pwd)/knowledge:/app/knowledge" \
  medibridge python -m medibridge.data.ingest

# Run server
docker run \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  -v "$(pwd)/knowledge:/app/knowledge" \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  medibridge
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `data/` volume must contain an already-ingested `medibridge.db` (and optionally `chroma/`) before starting the server.

---

## Architecture

Dual-store agentic RAG: SQLite for structured data, ChromaDB for semantic search. LangGraph drives a ReAct loop over six tools.

```
CLI (cli.py + onboarding.py)
  └─> LangGraph ReAct agent (agent/graph.py)
        └─> 6 LangChain @tools (tools/)
              ├─> SQLite: mbs_items, insurer_tiers, oshc_coverage_rules, clinics
              └─> ChromaDB: mbs_descriptions, oshc_rules
```

### Agent tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_mbs_items` | Hybrid RRF search (vector + FTS5) |
| `lookup_mbs_item` | Exact item lookup by number |
| `calculate_oshc_coverage` | Out-of-pocket cost estimate |
| `check_waiting_period` | Waiting months / served status |
| `query_oshc_rules` | Semantic policy retrieval |
| `search_clinics` | Queensland clinic directory |
